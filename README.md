<h1> ~ User Story ~ </h1>
<p> 
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position </p>

<h2> ~ Acceptance Criteria ~ </h2>
<p> 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport </p>

<h3> ~ Live Website ~ </h3>

<h5> ~ Notes ~ </h5>
<p>
- I used an avatar image instead of an image of myself.
- When clicking the "coming soon" image it will link you to a site that says "projects coming soon."
